Given a text file as input (arg[0]), the program recognizes people names 
and locations, and counts their occurrences.

Only a fragment of the Reuters-21578 corpus is included. To download the
full corpus go to:

The input file reut2-000.sgm is an example of messy data:

 - DOCTYPE lewis.dtd does not fit the sgm data
 - Special characters such as "&#3;" gives org.xml.sax.SAXParseException
 - A mix of "<" and "&lt;"s in the BODY elements
 - Misspelled words, such as "Preesident Nixon"
 
This program is able to handle such messy data.
